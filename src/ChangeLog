--------------- Version 1.1.0 ---------------
Aug 05 2014
    Added vendor field in usNIC RPM metadata

Jul 24 2014
    Added capability reporting function.

    The alloc_context routine will now return a structure specifying the
    capabilities of the device and driver.  This is important so that Intel MPI
    can detect whether the driver supports CQ sharing.

Jul 23 2014
    move usnic_ib_abi.h from libusnic_verbs to common directory so other
    libraries may access it

Jul 11 2014
    Move license insertion routine into libusnic_verbs top level Makefile

Jul 08 2014
    Print local and remote addresses as IP instead of GIDs.

    In addition, removed gid index in option as it is not needed, fixed a
    compiling warning, and changed the latency measurement to time used for half
    round trip.

Jun 24 2014
    Added a new vnic API to seperate devcmd initialization from
    vnic_dev_register

    Also added a fallback arugment for function vnic_dev_cmd_init(), which would
    fallback to the original devcmd if devcmd2 resource is not present and
    fallback is required.

Jun 06 2014
    ibv_devinfo command is not currently showing usnic firmware version

May 07 2014
    Change error return code to positive for certain functions.

    For functions called by libibverbs APIs such as ibv_create_qp,
    ibv_post_recv, changed error return code as positive. In addition, use
    MACROs to differentiate functions in the same target in the Makefile.

May 06 2014
    Remove the limit for 4k MTU in usnic_udp_pingpong

    Modified usnic_udp_pingpong to get MTU by querying the ethernet device
    corresponding to the ibv device instead of calling ibv_query_port, which
    always returns MTU size one of values in [256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096].

May 03 2014
    USNIC: usnic rpm file name should have rhel version as enic's

May 02 2014
    Generate RELEASE_VERSION in source tarball to keep SVN information

Apr 23 2014
    Fixed usnic Makefile such that VPATH (out-of-srcdir) builds work again

Apr 22 2014
    Removed lingering TMP_VNIC_CMD_DIR variable

Apr 22 2014
    Libusnic makefile cleanup

Apr 22 2014
    Fixed a bug that ibv_devinfo command is not currently showing usnic firmware
    version

Apr 21 2014
    Added ability to report packet and byte statistics from libusnic_verbs

    If USNIC_QP_STATS is defined in environment, the ibv_destroy_qp() call will
    print per-QP stastics to stdout. Packet count is number of IP packets sent,
    and byte count is number of bytes send, counting IP headers (but not ether
    headers)

Apr 17 2014
    Changed create_ah implemenation to use ioctl instead of libnl to query arp
    entry.

    Previous implementation of create_ah returns ENIOX when queried entry is in
    FAILED state, which causes MPI to fail at initialization stage if the entry
    enters into false FAILED state due to lost of ARP request/reply messages
    caused by network congestion. This implemention uses ioctl API to avoid
    dealing with kernel APR entry states explicitly and retries querying and
    triggers ARP resolution no matter that the query for an entry fails or is
    ongoing.

Mar 26 2014
    Fixed container_of re-definition warnings

    Changed libusnic_verbs to have its very own shiny usnic_container_of macro,
    and use that everywhere.

Mar 21 2014
    Bumped libusnic_verbs version number for changing transport format to ip/udp

--------------- Version 1.0.2 ---------------
Mar 20 2014
    Fixed create_qp() failure when multiple contexts are created for a single
    device

    When an new context is created, check if the device is marked as udp
    transport, meaning another ctx created on the device is enabled with udp.
    If so, it is not neccessary to assign NULL function pointers for op struct
    of this context. Otherwise, later invocation of create_qp() on this context
    would fail since enable_udp routine assigns function pointers back to op
    struct only when dev is marked as udp enabled.

    In addition, pthread_mutex_init call is added for usnic_context.vf_lst_lock.

Mar 13 2014
    Added usnic_udp_pingpong program that works on libusnic_verbs udp
    transport.

    This commit includes a usnic_udp_pingpong program modifed from
    ibv_ud_pingpong in libibverbs in the package. This program works with
    libusnic_verbs udp transport.

Mar 13 2014
    Fixed compiling errors and warnings introduced by the vnic_rq changes

    Included <stdbool.h> in kcompat.h file in order for libusnic_verbs to
    compile successfully. Otherwise, bool/true/false are not defined. Also
    fixed unused arguments warnings.

Mar 11 2014
    Added an m4 empty folder into repository to fix an erorr when running
    autogen.sh

Mar 10 2014
    Added libusnic_verbs routability support with udp header format

    Usnic now uses udp/ip instead layer 2 with 8915 ether type as the
    transport header format.
    Configuration parameter --with-8915 is used to switch between two
    transport format for different builds.
    Enabled routability support by implementing destination route lookup
    and ARP resolution in function ibv_create_ah().
    Enabled usnic verbs extension for applications to bypass libibverbs
    to enable certain features, including enabling UDP and getting
    transport packet header length.
